Introduction to C @VUB_ELO-ICT

## Project Description

### What
This project contains exercices from the Work Sessions. 

### Goals
The goal of this project is to develop:
- algoritmic thinking 
- programming efficiency
- targeted debugging techniques

- linear programming

### Personal Goals
Aside this project I also wanted to discover Github and his tool git.
In order to:
- get version control
- post issues
- write some documentation
- share code with classmates 
- use repo between my devices

## Deploy project
This project has been written within vscode in Ubuntu 20.04.
Ubuntu has been installed bare metal (in dualboot aside W10) for better performance compared to a VM with Ubuntu & easiness compared to W10.

### Instructions
1. Open terminal
2. Go to correct directory (ex : ./wpo1)
3. Execute Makefile
4. Call exe
PS: Uncomment/Comment the code within <wpox_main.c> to test the desired functions
